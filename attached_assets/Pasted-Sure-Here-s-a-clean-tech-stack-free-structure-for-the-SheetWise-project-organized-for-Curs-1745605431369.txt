## ðŸ§  Project: `sheetwise`

### âœ¨ Overview
A clean, intuitive web tool that lets users upload Excel, CSV, or Google Sheets, ask questions about the data using natural language, and receive both analysis and visual visualizations â€” all wrapped in a visually calming mint green (#98FF98) and white interface inspired by Ocean Sentinel.

### Capabilities
- parse and clean uploaded sheet data

- support multiple queries in a session  
- maintain lightweight logs for analysis  
- handle both metric-based and insight-based queries
